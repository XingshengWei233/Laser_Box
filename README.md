Author: Jiyuan Hu, Xingsheng Wei
## Discription
Use MATLAB to write a program that takes several input parameters (size, lid, etc.) and generate an SVG file that describes a box to be cut on acrylic with a laser cutter.
## Content
Wrote a LaserBox class that contains the parameters and functions that generates each feature (faces, lid, text) of the box.

Added a function to the LaserBox class to write XML text of the SVG format to an SVG file.

Wrote a main script to ask the user to input the parameters and generate the SVG file.
